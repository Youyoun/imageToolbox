A toolbox containing utility functions needed to train imaging models for denoising/deblurring tasks. Contains a bunch of tools to manipulate Neural network jacobians, compute proximal/Tseng descente, and some basic operators. 

You can install this package by cloning it and running:

```
cd imageToolbox
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

Don't forget to create a virtual environment !
